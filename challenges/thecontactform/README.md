# The Contact Form
This challenge will test your front-end Javascript and DOM skills.

## Instructions
Add the following features to the contact form in `index.html`:

  - Validate the form according to the following rules:
    - All fields are required.
    - The value of the `email` field should look like an email address (it's up to you what that means).
    - The `comments` field must contain at least 3 words.
  - When the form is submitted and validation passes, send the contents via AJAX `POST` to a request collection service such as [http://requestb.in/](http://requestb.in/).
  - Provide visual feedback to the user when the form is successfully submitted or validation fails.

## Considerations

Any external Javascript libraries may be used (or not). 
This is an exercise to gauge your coding style and thoroughness.
